            <p>I am a sophomore in the <a href="https://cse.kangwon.ac.kr/" target="_blank">Department of Computer Science and Engineering</a> at Kangwon national university. I'm studying basic content to be a programmer, such as web programming, linear algebra, data structure, Python, and so on. I want to study various fields and have extensive knowledge. Recently, I have been interested in Python and web programming.</p>

        <div id="page2" class="page">
            <h1>Interest</h1>
            <hr>
            <h2>Python</h2>
            <p>Python's intuitive grammar has been appealing since I first started programming. That's why I chose Python as my introduction to programming, and it's the longest and most consistent language I've been studying. I am studying discrete mathematics and linear algebra using Python. I naturally became interested because I am using Python to apply it to various fields.</p>
            <br>
            <h2>Basketball</h2>
            <p>I have played basketball as a hobby since I was in middle school. I like team sports because I like to compete and win there. The process of challenging, growing, and overcoming has had a positive impact not only in sports but also in many places in life. Also, I try to play basketball consistently because it helps my physical strength.</p>

        <div id="page3" class="page">
            <h1>Realization</h1>
            <hr>
            <h2>Making a web page..</h2>
            <p>Although I came to create this page as a web programming assignment, it was very helpful. I think my programming skills improved a little by searching a lot to create this page and reviewing what I learned in class. I realized that it was more fun than I thought to do something on my own, going beyond learning.It was a great experience. I should work harder to fill this self-introduction page from now on.</p>
